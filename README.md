# Key Features
### 1. Responsive Layout
- The website layout is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes such as mobile, desktop.

- It uses TailwindCSS for quick and efficient styling, ensuring an attractive and adaptable user interface.
### 2. Fetching Data from APIs
- The website fetches pet data from an external API, ensuring that the data displayed on the site is dynamic and up-to-date.
- Data for pet categories and individual pets are fetched using fetch API calls.
### 3. Pet Categories
- Categories of pets (such as dogs, cats, etc.) are fetched from an API and displayed as buttons.

- Clicking on a category button fetches and displays pets belonging to that category dynamically.
### 4. Pet Listings
- Pets are displayed in a grid layout with relevant details like breed, gender, birth date, price, and more.
- Each pet card has buttons for viewing details, liking the pet (which adds the pet to a "liked" section), and adopting.
- When adopting, a countdown timer is triggered, and the "Adopt" button becomes disabled.

- After the countdown ends, the modal closes, and the adoption process continues.

- This section displays all the pets the user has shown interest in.
